California Housing Prices EDA
Overview
This Git repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for housing prices in California. The dataset includes various features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

Exploratory Data Analysis Questions
1. Average Median Income and Distribution
Explore the average median income of the dataset and visualize its distribution using appropriate plots. Provide an explanation of the distribution observed.

2. Housing Median Age Distribution
Draw a plot to examine the distribution of housing median age and provide insights based on your observations.

3. Relationship between Median Income and Median House Values
Use visualizations to demonstrate how median income and median house values are related.

4. Dataset without Total Bedrooms
Create a new dataset by removing examples where total bedrooms are not available.

5. Dataset with Imputed Total Bedrooms
Generate a dataset by filling missing data in the total bedrooms column with the mean value from the original dataset.

6. User-Defined Function for Median Calculation
Write a programming construct, specifically a user-defined function, to calculate the median value of the dataset where required.

7. Latitude versus Longitude Plot
Plot latitude versus longitude and provide explanations based on your observations.

8. Dataset with Ocean Proximity 'Near Ocean'
Create a dataset containing examples where the ocean proximity is labeled as 'Near Ocean.'

9. Mean and Median of Median Income
Determine the mean and median of the median income for the dataset created in question 8.

10. Total Bedroom Size Categorization
Introduce a new column named 'total_bedroom_size.' Classify values as 'small' if total bedrooms are 10 or less, 'medium' if between 11 and 1000, and 'large' otherwise.

Dataset Information
The dataset comprises the following columns:
